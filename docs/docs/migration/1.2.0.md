# Migrate from Magda v1.0.0 / v1.1.0 to v1.2.0

## Elasticsearch Upgrade

In v1.2.0, we upgraded elasticsearch to 6.8.22 (from 6.5.4). Once you upgrade Magda to v1.2.0, indexer will auto-recreate all elasticsearch indexes for newer version elasticsearch engine. Depends on your database size, this might take some time.

To avoid showing incomplete result till re-index is completed, you can manually set the index version that search API uses to the existing versions via [helm chart options](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/944ae887842b98c51698d567435003be2e9dbefd/deploy/helm/internal-charts/search-api/values.yaml#L29).

e.g. you can set the following in your helm deployment values file / config:

```
search-api:
  datasetsIndexVersion: 47
  regionsIndexVersion: 24
  publishersIndexVersion: 5
  formatsIndexVersion: 1
```

to make search api still queries the previous version indexes while indexer's creating the new indexes.

The index version numbers above are the versions used in Magda release v1.1.0.

Once indexer fully completes the new version indexes, you can remove the above config from deployment config and deploy again to make search API uses the latest version indexes.

You can check the indexing progress via Indexer module logs.

You can also use the [reindex API](https://dev.magda.io/api/v0/apidocs/index.html#api-Indexer-PostHttpIndexerV0Reindex) (accessible within the cluster only) to re-trigger a full index progress, if Indexer's indexing progress is interrupted for any reason before fully complete.
