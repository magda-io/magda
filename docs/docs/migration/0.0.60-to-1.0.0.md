# Migrate from Magda v0.0.60 to v1.0.0

## Upgrade database

Magda v1.0.0 is the first version that targets postgreSQL version 13.

Although Magda v1.0.0 is still compatiable with postgreSQL v9.6, it's recommended to upgrade to postgreSQL version 13 ASAP as [there will be no more updates/patches for postgreSQL 9.6 after November 11, 2021](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

If you use database service from cloud providers, you can follow the instructions from the service providers to upgrade your database. e.g.:

- For Google CloudSQL users, you can use [Database Migration Service](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/database-cloud-migrations-made-easy-for-postgresql-mysql).
  - We also have upgrade guide document for this option [here](./upgrade-google-cloud-sql-using-google-dms.md).
- For AWS RDS users, you can simply [modify RDS instance settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.MajorVersion) and choose postgreSQL version 13.

If you use in-k8s postgreSQL dataset instance that comes with Magda, you will need to manually migrate & upgrade your data.

There are [3 options](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/upgrading.html) to achieve this.

Here, we cover one option that is to use [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-pgdump.html) & [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-pgrestore.html) to migrate & upgrade your data:

- 1> Use [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-pgdump.html) to create database dump of all databases. They are:
  - `postgres` (registry DB)
  - `content`
  - `auth`
  - `session`
  - `tenant` (Only needed if you turned on the multitenancy feature)

You can use a command similar to the following:

```bash
PGPASSWORD=[DBPassword] pg_dump -h [DBHostName] -U postgres -Fc [DBName] > [DBName].dump
```

Here:

- `[DBPassword]` is the password for the default super user account `postgres`. If there is no password is set for `postgres` account, you can remove the `PGPASSWORD=[DBPassword]` portion from the command.
- `[DBHostName]` is the host name of database instance.
  - If you want to run it on your local machine, you need to [port-forward](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/) the database pod and put `localhost` as hostname.
- `[DBName]` is one of five database listed above
- `-Fc` switch makes `pg_dump` output a custom-format archive suitable for input into `pg_restore`.

- 2> Upgrade Magda to v1.0.0.

- 3> Use [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-pgrestore.html) to restore database from the dataset dump files.

You can use a command similar to the following:

```bash
PGPASSWORD=[DBPassword] pg_restore --clean --if-exists --disable-triggers -d [DBName] -U postgres -h [DBHostName] [DBName].dump
```

Here:

- `[DBPassword]` is the password for the default super user account `postgres`. Since Magda v1.0.0, supper user account user password compulsory and will be auto-generated (unless supplied). You can find it from secret `db-main-account-secret`.
- `[DBHostName]` is the host name of database instance.
  - If you run this command in the same cluster, you can use `combined-db-postgresql.[namespace].svc.cluster.local`. `[namespace]` is your magda deployment namespace.
- `[DBName]` is one of five database listed above
- `--clean --if-exists` switches make `pg_restore` drop the dataset objects before importing the data so that we don't need to worry about `duplicate keys` error.
- `--disable-triggers` switch will temporarily disable foreign key constraints and triggers so that we won't encounter `violates foreign key constraints` errors due to the restore sequence of the table data.

- 4> Magda V1.0.0 will create a new [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) without deleting the [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) for the older version database. After the data migration is complete, you can delete the `Persistent Volume Claim` for the old dataset to release / delete the `Persistent Volume`. The default `Persistent Volume Claim` name for the older version database is `combined-db-combined-db-0`.

## Incompatible Changes

### Removal of `noDbAuth` mode

Previously, you can set `global.noDbAuth` to `true` to allow logging into in-k8s postgreSQL instance with no password. This option has been removed since v1.0.0, you are required to remove `global.noDbAuth` option from your config to avoid problems.

### Manually Turned On `correspondence-api` if required

Since v1.0.0 (see ticket #3221), correspondence-api is not part of default modules anymore.
i.e. the default `true` value for `tags.all` won't turn on `correspondence-api` by default.
If your deployment requires `correspondence-api`, you need to manually set `tags.correspondence-api` to `true` to turn it on.
