# Backward incompatible changes in v1.3.0

In v1.3.0, we removed all legacy auth providers and converted them into auth plugins in separate repos (See issue: https://github.com/magda-io/magda/issues/3020).

If you use the following auth providers priori to v1.3.0, you should switch to auth plugin versions instead:

- [AAF](https://aaf.edu.au/). Auth plugin repo: [magda-auth-aaf](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-aaf)
- [arcgis / ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview). Auth plugin repo: [magda-auth-arcgis](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-arcgis)
- [facebook]. Auth plugin repo: [magda-auth-facebook](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-facebook)
- [VANguard](https://www.industry.gov.au/government-to-government/vanguard). Auth plugin repo: [magda-auth-vanguard](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-vanguard)
  - This is a private repo at this moment and requires some internal tools to generate metadata and setup.

Since v1.3.0, we also added `global.authPluginAllowedExternalRedirectDomains` as part of [Auth Plugin Spec](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/7955f8b5c1eb07c5cf5dfa4fa15dbec0c1789cf3/docs/docs/authentication-plugin-spec.md) and updated [authentication-plugin-sdk](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/tree/7955f8b5c1eb07c5cf5dfa4fa15dbec0c1789cf3/packages/authentication-plugin-sdk).

> Please note: as all legacy auth providers are removed, the api endpoint `/auth/providers` has been removed as well.

Existing auth plugins still work with v1.3.0 Magda & `authentication-plugin-sdk` without requiring any adjustment. But it's recommended to upgrade existing auth plugin codes to utilize the new `global.authPluginAllowedExternalRedirectDomains` config value.
