# Migrate from Magda v0.0.59 to v0.0.60.md

v0.0.60 includes changes to the dataset index versions [(from `46` to `47`)](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/41e648c4160b989fca7847a6b6afc98bffce8b95/magda-scala-common/src/main/resources/common.conf#L17).

Although Magda will auto-build the new version index, it might take some time if you have large amount data.

Within this time window, users might see partial results. If you want to avoid this, you can manually set search API dataset index version to `46` to make it query the existing old version index before new version index is built:

```yaml
search-api: datasetsIndexVersion=46
```

And remove this manual config after the new version index is fully built.
