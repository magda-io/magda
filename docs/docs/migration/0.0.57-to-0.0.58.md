### Migrate from Magda 0.0.57 to 0.0.58

#### Upgrade Gateway Authentication Provider Config

Since 0.0.58, we introduced the [Authentication Plugin](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/master/docs/docs/authentication-plugin-spec.md) concept to MAGDA that allows our users to develop external plugins that supports their identity providers or customise the user on-boarding logic. We also removed the following authentication provider from our core codebase and converted them into `authentication plugins`:

-   [magda-auth-google](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-google)
-   [magda-auth-ckan](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-ckan)
-   [magda-auth-internal](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-internal) (Local account & password authentication)
-   [magda-auth-arcgis](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-arcgis) (not removed from core codebase yet)

If you use any of the authentication providers, you need to update your deploy config to use the authentication plugins instead. You can find setup information regarding each of the plugins from the repo links above. You also can find an example of setting up MAGDA helm config to use authentication plugins from [here](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/commit/ddba7183d6195d4cd99c8c0b0cf0b08a78552b1e). Our [Gateway Helm Chart Document](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/master/deploy/helm/internal-charts/gateway/README.md) also provides information of relevant config options.

#### Upgrade Internal Storage

> This migration procedure is only required if you:
> 1> use Magda's storage API to store your data files
> 2> You chose to use cluster internal storage as the file storage

Magda v0.0.58 upgrades [minio](https://github.com/minio/charts) to 7.1.2 that supports all file storage releated service. If you chose to store data file in magda internal storage on earlier Magda versions, you will need to performance the following upgrade steps.

-   Delete `minio` deployment: `kubectl -n <your namespace> delete deploy magda-minio`
-   Deploy a shell pod to access the persistent volume:

```
kubectl -n <your namespace> apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/t83714/b52f699c394f4a2150212f24fd7aa4fa/raw/b7d5784b1ef6d39ce542b3b998f136d9d08e3fd9/shell-pod.yaml
```

-   Gain the shell access to the shell pod: `kubectl -n <your namespace> exec -it shell-pod -- /bin/bash`
-   `cd /export` and run the following cmds on all dirs list by `ls -la`
-   `chown -R 1000 <data-dir> && chmod u+rxw <data-dir>`
-   Delete the shell pod
-   Deploy v0.0.58
