## v2.0.0

v2.0.0 is the first **major release** since v1.0.0 was released last year. This release focuses on implementing [the new policy engine based authorisation system design](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/master/docs/docs/architecture/Guide%20to%20Magda%20Internals.md#new-authorisation-model--implementation).

### Overview

Before v2.0.0, we had started introducing the [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) as the central policy engine serving authorisation decisions at a handful of API endpoints. However, the following problems prevent us from rolling out the design to the whole system:

- Lack of abstraction at the policy level. It is hard to reuse the policy logic when it comes to the situation where:
  - One resource resides in more than one storage engine. e.g. dataset metadata are stored both in PostgreSQL & Elasticsearch)
  - Or one resource might belong to a subset defined by another type of resource. e.g. a dataset record is a record that carries `dcat-dataset-string` aspect.
  - Or the decision of one resource depends on another resource.
- Policy files are created to serve the decision of the designated operation of the resource (e.g. read). The system is required to look up a pre-defined field (e.g. `authnReadPolicyId`) to pick a responsible policy file.
- Didn't fully leverage the partial evaluation feature of the OPA, and the performance issue that comes with it when making group decisions. e.g. get all available records
- Inaccurate OPA AST parser (e.g. not support `negated`) and local query translator

To solve those issues, we introduced a new authorisation system design & implementation that:

- Introduce a new decision API endpoint, a single entry point policy model and operation URI (e.g. `object/record/read`) to ensure decision requests are properly routed. e.g.:
  - When making group decisions over a superset resource (e.g. `object/record`), a joined decision will be given, including all subset resources policies (e.g. `object/dataset`, `object/distribution` etc.).
  - A dataset record will always be governed by the policy of resource `object/dataset`, no matter whether we query it via registry API (require the permission of `object/record/record` operation) or dataset search API (require the permission of `object/dataset/read` operation) as the resource `object/dataset` is a subset of resource `object/record`.
- Eliminate the need to manually specify the policy file (e.g. via `authnReadPolicyId` field) with the help of the single entry point policy model. Make it possible to create user-defined resources & operations.
- Fully leverage the partial evaluation feature of the OPA. Only requires one decision, even for making group decisions. e.g. get all records that the user is allowed to see.
- More accurate OPA AST parser with performance improvement. e.g. auto-filtering duplicated rules & impossible rules and recognising rules that can be evaluated further

### More Powerful APIs with fine-grained access control

Thanks to the new authorisation system design. We are able to re-implement fine-grained access control to **ALL** our existing APIs.

Many APIs (e.g. indexer APIs) that previously were not accessible outside the cluster can be accessible outside the cluster as we are able to grant access to non-admin users that enable more use cases.

With the help of the new policy mode, we still are able to make sure all APIs are compatible with existing plugins & sub-systems. Although all requests between sub-systems are now all governed by the policy engine now, requests from existing sub-systems will still work as existing admin users still have access to any resources.

However, authors of existing plugins/sub-systems might consider updating the code and using an account with the least privilege to communicate with the core APIs as it's possible now with fine-grained access control of APIs.

### New Settings Panel

v2.0.0 also comes with a new settings panel for all signed-in users. Depending on your access, you might have access to different sections. e.g. all users should at least be able to access the "My Account" tab and users with the admin role can access all tabs. The settings panel UI is supplied to simplify the common admin tasks such as: users, roles, permissions, resources and operations management.

For a brand new system, to assign the admin role to the first user, please refer to [this doc](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/master/docs/docs/how-to-set-user-as-admin-user.md) to set a user as admin using `acs-cmd` command line tool.

### Github Container Registry

Since v2.0.0, we also publish all our helm chart & docker images to [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/magda-io/packages?repo_name=magda) (in addition to existing HTTP helm chart repo & docker hub docker image releases ).

If you want to try our helm chart via OCI registry or prefer using a different docker registry other than the docker hub, you can give it a try.

### Breaking Changes & Compatibility

- Setting a policy for a record via the `authnReadPolicyId` field is not supported anymore.
  - Please manage access to registry records via built-in permission & constraints. See [permissions/role section of our architecture doc](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/master/docs/docs/architecture/Guide%20to%20Magda%20Internals.md#permissions--roles).
  - You can still supply your policy files to extend the authorization model. However, your policy must comply with the single entry point policy model. e.g. a policy governing resources `object/resourceB` should be put into package `object.resourceB`. You might also want to read the [decision API doc](https://magda-io.github.io/api-docs/index.html#api-Auth-PostV0AuthOpaDecisionPath)
- `isAdmin` field on the user will no longer grant the user admin permission.
- All scripts / command line tools now require [Node 14](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Previously `dataset-access-control` aspect has been renamed to `access-control` aspect
  - `orgUnitOwnerId` field has been renamed to `orgUnitId`
  - `custodianOrgUnitId` field has been moved to `publishing` aspect

### Migration

If you are on version <= v1.3.1, you should be able to migrate to v2.0.0 simply by deploying the v2.0.0 Helm Chart.

> Please note: any authorisation model implemented with external policy files will need to reimplement on top of v2 authorisation model.

If you are any v2 alpha versions (e.g. v2.0.0-alpha.8), you will have to completely uninstall Magda before upgrading to v2.0.0 as the SQL migration files won't tell the difference between v2.0.0 and any of the v2 alpha versions.
