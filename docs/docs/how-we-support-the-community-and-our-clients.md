# How We Support the Community and Our Clients

## Open-Source Community Support

Magda is, at its core, an open-source platform. We maintain and evolve the software in the open so that anyone can use it, adapt it, and help shape its future.

We support the open-source community by:

- Releasing Regular Updates: We actively develop and publish new features, fixes, and improvements through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/releases).
- Issue Tracking & Discussions: We monitor GitHub issues and our Discussions board, offering prompt responses to bugs, enhancement ideas, and user questions.
- Open Documentation: Our installation guides, technical references, and tutorials are public and continuously updated.
- Welcoming Contributions: We encourage users and developers to get involved - whether by submitting an issue, proposing an enhancement, or opening a pull request. Every contribution helps improve the platform for everyone.
- If you're using Magda and have ideas, suggestions, or improvements - we'd love to hear from you.

## Supporting Clients with Paid Engagements

While Magda is open-source, many organisations engage us directly to help them deploy, customise, and support the platform in production settings. Based on prior client work, we offer three flexible engagement models:

### Expert Guidance for In-House Teams

Best suited for clients with internal software engineers.

We provide:

- Architecture reviews and solution design
- Guidance on custom feature development
- On-demand technical support to help unblock your developers quickly

This model enables your team to retain full control while benefiting from our experience.

### Co-Development with Handover

Ideal for teams without software developers but with internal operations, data, or infrastructure capacity.

We offer:

- Collaborative feature design: We work closely with your team to design custom features that meet your needs
- End-to-end development: Our team takes care of the actual implementation
- Deployment to your infrastructure: We set up everything in your environment
- Clear documentation and training: Ensuring your team is ready for long-term maintenance

This model gets you up and running quickly, while ensuring your team is equipped for ongoing operations.

### Fully Managed Service

Whether you're a small organisation or a large enterprise that prefers not to manage the technical side â€” we've got you covered.

We offer:

- Taken full responsibility for design, deployment, infrastructure setup, deployment and support
- Proactive upgrades, maintenance, and incident response
- A long-term partnership model with full accountability

This approach works well for any client who wants a "done-for-you" experience - and trusts the team who built Magda to run it best.
