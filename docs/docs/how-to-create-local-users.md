# How to create Local Users

> Please note: local authentication feature has been moved out as an [Authentication Plugin](./authentication-plugin-spec.md) to repo [magda-auth-internal](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-internal). You need to deploy the plugin to turn on this feature.

Magda now support creating local authenticated users (instead of SSO). You can use the `set-user-password` script to create users / set password for users. Please note: users will need to use their email address as username to login.

Before start to use the `set-user-password script, you need to:

- Clone [magda-auth-internal repo](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-auth-internal)
- Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies
- Port forward the Magda database to local:
  - `kubectl port-forward combined-db-postgresql-0 5432:5432`
  - If you didn't install magda to the default namespace, you can use: `kubectl port-forward -n [namespace] combined-db-postgresql-0 5432:5432`

> Prior to Magda v1.0.0, you should port-forward pod combined-db-0

After the installation is done, run `yarn set-user-password` will list help information as below:
