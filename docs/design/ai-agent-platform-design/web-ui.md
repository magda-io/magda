# Web and product integration design

**Status:** Draft  
**Owner ticket:** TBD  
**Depends on:** #3823, #3824, #3825 and mutation approval

## Product lifecycle

The web client exposes one current agent per authenticated Magda user.

Expected lifecycle:

- no current Sandbox -> create/open agent;
- ALLOCATING/BOOTSTRAPPING -> show provisioning state;
- READY -> show proxied DSH UI;
- SUSPENDED -> reconnect wakes the same Sandbox/PVC;
- FAILED/DEGRADED -> show actionable status;
- "new agent" warns that current workspace/session state will be deleted, then replaces it;
- explicit logout triggers immediate sandbox/key cleanup.

The normal 30-minute idle suspend is not a user-visible destructive event; returning resumes the same PVC-backed session. The 8-hour hard idle deletion is destructive and starts fresh next time.

## DSH presentation

Reuse DSH's conversation/tool UI rather than rebuilding the coding-agent frontend.

Magda deployment controls provider/model selection. The production Magda DSH profile should hide/disable generic model selector, model settings and plugin-management surfaces where supported.

New DSH sessions default to `workspace-write` with approval policy `ask`. The managed Magda UI hides the persistent `danger-full-access` selection. Per-action approval remains available when DSH decides an operation needs confirmation/escalation.

The human terminal and unrestricted workspace picker should remain hidden/disabled in normal production unless the later security design explicitly approves them.

## Gateway/proxy

Magda Gateway remains the external same-origin entry point.

DSH traffic is proxied:

```text
Browser -> Magda Gateway -> Agent Manager -> Sandbox Service -> DSH
```

The browser never receives a Pod/Sandbox address.

#3824 is Accepted based on #3841. DSH binds directly to the Sandbox Pod network; there is no bridge sidecar. Stock DSH launch-token/cookie authentication is retained for MVP but held entirely server-side by Agent Manager, and `X-Magda-Session` never enters the Sandbox.

## LLM controls

Users do not directly enter OpenAI/Anthropic/AWS/Azure credentials into DSH.

The sandbox is preconfigured to use Magda LLM Services. The default model/reasoning effort is deployment/product policy, and model availability is ultimately enforced by Magda authorisation.

A future product design may expose a Magda-native authorised model selector, but DSH's generic provider-management UI is not the source of truth.

## Migration

Keep the existing WebGPU agent available during early v8 transition behind a separate feature/entry point. Decide later whether it remains a local/privacy mode or is deprecated.
