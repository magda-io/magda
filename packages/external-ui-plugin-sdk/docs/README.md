### MAGDA External UI Plugin SDK

Magda allows you to build / bundle React UI components with your own logic and supply the customised UI components to Magda at the time of deployment (via [Helm chart config](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/tree/master/deploy/helm/internal-charts/web-server)) to replace the functionality of existing UI components. For those custom built UI components, we call External UI Plugin Components.

For more information of how to create / config External UI Plugin Components, please refer to [magda-plugin-ui-component-examples repo](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-plugin-ui-component-examples).

This SDK at this moment only contains typescript types of all key data structures.

Not all built-in Magda built-in components can be replaced by an External UI Plugin Component.

For the list of replacable components, please refer to exported component types.

SDK document is available from [here](./docs/modules.md).
