> You will need to port forward the Magda database to localhost to make sure the utility can connect to your Magda database.

- To do so, You can run `kubectl port-forward combined-db-postgresql-0 5432`.
  - If you didn't install magda to the default namespace, you can use: `kubectl port-forward -n [namespace] combined-db-postgresql-0 5432`

> Prior to Magda v1.0.0, you should port-forward pod combined-db-0

#### Example

View organisation unit hierarchy tree:
