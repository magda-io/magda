# -- (string) Sets the maximum amount of memory that the JVM heap (via flag `-Xmx`) can grow to.
# You can set `jvmInitialHeapSize` to the same value for production use case to avoid JVM heap resizing.
# Should make sure leave enough room for non-heap overhead to avoid OOM.
# e.g. if you set `resources.limits.memory` (Pod Memory) to 256 MiB, you should set this value to 128 MiB to leave 128 MiB for non-heap overhead to avoid OOM.
# - For Pod memory 512 MiB, we should set this value to 256 MiB.
# - 768 MiB Pod memory, should set this value to 512 MiB.
# - Over 1GiB Pod memory, can reserve 60-70% to heap.
# value should be in format of `1g` or `200m` etc.
