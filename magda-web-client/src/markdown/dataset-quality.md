### HOW WE MEASURE DATA QUALITY

We calculate data quality based on open data best practices. For this, we use [Tim Berners-Lee's open data scale](http://5stardata.info/en/) , which is specific enough to be useful but vague enough to be future-proof. It's adopted by many open data portals around the world.

For each of the following points, we add 20% to the data quality rating. These work like building blocks, for a dataset to get 4 stars, it has to meet the first four steps.

1.  Is the data available on the web in any format with an open license?
2.  Is it available as structured data? For example, Excel instead of image scan of a table.
3.  Is it available in a non-proprietary format? For example, CSV instead of Excel.
4.  Does the data have URIs to denote things. so that people can point to your stuff?
5.  Do you link your data to other data to provide context?

We will continue to update the data quality rating as research continues. If you have any feedback [get in touch](mailto:data@digital.gov.au) , or if you're passionate about data quality, get involved in the [Australian Government Linked Data Working Group.](http://linked.data.gov.au/)
