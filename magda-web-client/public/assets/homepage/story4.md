<p>This community is for people who work with open data in the Australian Public Service or who carry out publicly-funded research.</p>

<p>It’s also for people who develop, innovate or carry out research using Australian government open datasets.</p>

<p>Our communities of practice bring together our colleagues to collaborate, showcase work, solve problems and explore best practice.</p>

<p>It's new and open for everyone.</p>
